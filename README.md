## Hi there 👋

I'm Steffan, a compsci connoisseur who finds passion in discovering, breaking, understanding and rebuilding things into a newer more optimized product.  

The current tech stacks that I am most familiar with are:
- M(P)ERN for full stack development
- Java + Springboot for robust backend functionalities
- Pandas + Numpy + Sklearn + Matplotplib + Seaborn + Tensorflow + Pytorch for DS/ML/DL modeling

While delving deeper into the technologies above I am also currently learning:
- The AWS cloud stack
- Docker containerization's
- Kubernetes
